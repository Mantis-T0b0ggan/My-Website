                        My name is Tim Ducharme, I currently work as a Field Services Engineer at Control-Tech. I travel throughout New England to different job sites to perform a variaty of tasks. Most often I am providing start-up for a new system. Essentially walking into a building where the lighting and other building controls are not working - I have a set of plans and I program devices to work correctly based on what has been approved. I work very closely with a vast group of people - from project manager, to spec sales teams, electricians and general contractors as well as building management and IT teams. I have to know the devices and how they interact with others and are programmed and be able to explain that to highly technical IT personel and spec sales teams. As well as break it down for end-users and contractors. I also spend a lot of my time on sites troubleshooting problems that come up after years of use, new install
                        or network problems, so knowing hardware and software is critical to my job.<br>
                        <br>
                        I've always had a dream to be part of a development team writing and executing code and building useful tools. I think the idea of creating a program that
                        can improve peoples day-to-days is amazing. Being part of a team where we are all working towards a common goal and putting our ideas out in front of 
                        eachother and building off them is something I throughly enjoy being part of. I'm very curious so I'm always asking questions, tinkering and learning 
                        as much as possible about new technologies.<br>
                        <br>
                        Other hobbies of mine include sports both playing and watching, playing video games with my brother and friends. Though I don’t participate in the game of lacrosse anymore I love watching it live or on T.V. I’m also a die-hard Boston sports fan of the Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox and Bruins. I enjoy watching coding tutorials online to continue to learn more about coding - Python right now espeially. I find coding to be fun and a challenge for me but a good kind of challenge. One that if I run into something new
                        or something won't work - I'm likely not alone and can usually find out the answer to my issues if needed.
